Socket Client
=============

The socket client uses the stream extension from PHP, which is integrated into
the core.

Features
--------

* TCP Socket Domain (``tcp://hostname:port``)
* UNIX Socket Domain (``unix:///path/to/socket.sock``)
* TLS / SSL encryption
* Client Certificate (only for PHP > 5.6)

Installation
------------

To install the Socket client, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ composer require php-http/socket-client

.. include:: includes/install-message-factory.inc

Usage
-----

The Socket client needs a :ref:`message factory <message-factory>` in order to
to work::

    use Http\Client\Socket\Client;

    $options = [];
    $client = new Client($messageFactory, $options);

The available options are:

:remote_socket: Specify the remote socket where the library should send the request to

    * Can be a TCP remote: ``tcp://hostname:port``
    * Can be a UNIX remote: ``unix:///path/to/remote.sock``
    * Do not use a TLS/SSL scheme, this is handle by the SSL option.
    * If not set, the client will try to determine it from the request URI or host header.
:timeout: Timeout in milliseconds for writing request and reading response on the remote
:ssl: Activate or deactivate SSL/TLS encryption
:stream_context_options: Custom options for the context of the stream. See `PHP stream context options <http://php.net/manual/en/context.php>`_.
:stream_context_params: Custom parameters for the context of the stream. See `PHP stream context parameters <http://php.net/manual/en/context.params.php>`_.
:write_buffer_size: When sending the request we need to buffer the body, this option specify the size of this buffer, default is 8192,
 if you are sending big file with your client it may be interesting to have a bigger value in order to increase performance.

As an example someone may want to pass a client certificate when using the ssl, a valid configuration for this
use case would be::

    use Http\Client\Socket\Client;

    $options = [
        'stream_context_options' => [
            'ssl' => [
                'local_cert' => '/path/to/my/client-certificate.pem'
            ]
        ]
    ];
    $client = new Client($messageFactory, $options);

.. warning::

    This client assumes that the request is compliant with HTTP 2.0, 1.1 or 1.0 standard. So a request without a ``Host`` header, or
    with a body but without a ``Content-Length`` will certainly fail.
    To make sure all requests will be sent out correctly, we recommend to use the ``PluginClient`` with the following plugins:

    * ``ContentLengthPlugin`` sets the correct ``Content-Length`` header, or decorate the stream to use chunked encoding
    * ``DecoderPlugin`` decodes encoding coming from the response (chunked, gzip, deflate and compress)
    * ``HeaderDefaultsPlugin`` sets default headers values if not present (like for the ``Host`` header)
